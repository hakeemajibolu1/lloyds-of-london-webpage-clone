        <p>How artificial intelligence and robots create new risks and opportunities for insurance

    <section>
        <p>As the world becomes increasingly automated, it is forcing underwriters to adapt and 
            navigate a new risk environment. Meanwhile insurers are leveraging the potential of AI 
            themselves to remain competitive, improve processes and increase efficiency. Lloyd’s 
            have commissioned two reports in collaboration with the University of Surrey that 
            explore these trends in more detail.</p>

        <p>“Taking control: artificial intelligence and insurance” analyses the associated risks of 
            AI implementation as well as the potential for AI to help insurers improve their operations 
            and develop new products. Building on this, “Taking control: robots and risk” investigates 
            the impact “collaborative robots” (or cobots) on the economy, and the subsequent risks 
            implications for the insurance industry.</p>

            <h3>Taking control: artificial intelligence and insurance</h3>
            <p>This report identifies four risks areas for AI: trust and transparency, ethics, security 
                and safety. It highlights that as artificial intelligence systems become more complex, 
                cyber breaches are likely to have an even greater impact. The report also explores new 
                business opportunities for insurers from developing new products for companies using the 
                AI to applying the technology to improve insurance processes and deliver better value.

            <h3>Taking control: robots and risk</h3>
            <p>In the future millions of jobs could be taken over by increasingly sophisticated robots or 
                cobots (“collaborative robots”), according to various predictions. This report explores 
                robotics potential to significantly change the risk landscape in many parts of the economy, 
                including: manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare and retail. It also explores the 
                opportunity for insurers to collaborate with clients as data from cobots will provide a 
                much greater understanding of risk and offer opportunities for improved risks and pricing 
                models.</p>
